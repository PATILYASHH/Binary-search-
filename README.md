# Binary Search Algorithm

This C program implements the binary search algorithm to find a target value in a sorted array.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C compiler such as GCC:
    ```
    gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
    ```

2. Run the compiled binary:
    ```
    ./binary_search
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to input the number of elements in the array, the elements themselves (in sorted order), and the target value to search for.

4. The program will output whether the target value was found in the array or not, along with its index if found.
